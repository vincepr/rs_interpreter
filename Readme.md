# Writing an Interpreter with Rust
The book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) by Robert Nystrom as a guide, the goal is to dip my toes into writing a Interpreter and Parser.
- Goal of this project is to write all code in Rust instead of the Java used in the book.
